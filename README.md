ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning
This project builds a machine learning model to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck, based on real historical data from Kaggleâ€™s Titanic dataset.

Using passenger information such as age, sex, class, and fare, the model learns patterns that distinguish survivors from non-survivors. The project covers the full machine learning pipeline:

Data Exploration: Understanding survival trends, missing data, and feature relationships.

Data Cleaning: Handling null values, converting data types, and preparing the dataset.

Feature Engineering: Encoding categorical variables and selecting the most important features.

Model Building: Training classification models such as Logistic Regression and Decision Tree.

Evaluation: Measuring model accuracy and analyzing confusion matrices.

The goal is to gain hands-on experience in data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluationâ€”skills that are essential in any real-world data science project.
